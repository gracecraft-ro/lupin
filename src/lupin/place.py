"""`lupin place <task>` (issue #9, part of #2's fleet-CLI split): which
machine should run a task already routed to a model by `route`/`classify`.

Three steps, each reusing an already-landed module rather than
reimplementing it:

1. Classify + route (`classify.classify`, `route.route`) -- unchanged logic,
   just called from here with a synthetic issue dict when `<task>` is free
   text instead of a real GitHub issue.
2. Map the routed model to a provider (`route.provider_for_model`, re-exported
   here under the same name). The table lives in `route.py` because quota
   pacing needs it too, not because it is a `place`-only concern, and
   model-tiers.json's schema is about tiers, not accounts.
3. Score every machine the registry (`machines.py`, issue #7) knows about
   that reports quota (`quota.py`, issue #8) for that provider, and rank the
   candidates.

Judgment call -- "runs the provider": `machines.py`'s `providers` field is
still an unpopulated stub (see its own docstring -- nothing writes it yet).
The thing that *is* populated, per machine, every heartbeat, is `quota`
(`quota.snapshot()`, keyed by provider). A machine with a real percentage
for that provider is the signal this repo has today that the machine can
serve it: the quota reader opens the same credentials file the agent uses,
so a machine that cannot read a provider's quota does not have that
provider's key. An entry with no percentage is therefore skipped, not
ranked -- `snapshot()` writes one entry per known provider on every
heartbeat, so "the entry exists" is true for all of them and proves
nothing. When something starts writing `providers` for real, switch to that
instead -- it is the more direct signal, this is a stand-in.

Judgment call -- ranking and the `result` column: the issue's `--explain`
example ranks by (state, quest focus, free slots, heartbeat age) and labels
every non-picked machine with *why* it lost. This module sorts candidates
by that same tuple, then reports the first dimension where a machine's
tuple differs from the picked machine's -- that reproduces the example
exactly (a draining machine always reads "draining"; an online machine
beaten only on quest focus reads "not quest focus", even if it also has
fewer free slots).

Quota is not a ranking dimension here (issue #36): every provider is one
account shared by the whole fleet, so a quota reading can never actually
differ between two machines -- ranking by it could only ever produce ties,
and the old framing ("this machine has better quota") misdescribed what
was going on. Issue #30's burn-margin ranking and issue #32's per-machine
`quota_exhausted` skip/wait/downgrade are both removed for that reason;
quota now gates the model choice directly, in `route()`'s own pacing
(`pace.py`), before this module ever sees a machine list. `place()` just
reads `route()`'s result: `wait_seconds` set means every option `route()`
tried is blocked right now (wait, no machine ranking needed);
`downgraded_from` set means `route()` already moved off a blocked pick
onto another one.

Judgment call -- quest focus: `quest_focus_for` below maps a task's issue
number to its quest (if `quest.load_quests` -- issue #11 -- finds one in
the current repo whose sub-issues include it) and reads that quest's
`focus:<quest>` machine (docs/redis-schema.md, written by `lupin quest
focus`/`release`, issue #12). Free text has no issue number, an unresolved
issue number has no quest membership to check, and an issue outside every
quest's sub-issues matches nothing -- all three return `None`, same as an
unfocused quest, so every machine ties on that dimension exactly like an
ordinary (non-quest) task.

Judgment call -- no `--repo` flag on `place`: `<task>` is just an issue
number or free text, nothing else. A numeric task is looked up with
`gh issue view <N> --json ...`, which resolves against the *current
directory's* repo the same way every other `gh` call in this codebase does
(see `roadmap.py`) -- there is nowhere else to get a repo from. If `gh`
fails (no repo, not authed, issue missing) this falls back to classifying
on the bare number alone rather than erroring out -- a placement decision
is still useful even with a generic category/size.

This module picks a machine; it does not start an agent or loop. The result
contains the selected machine name in `pick`. A task is not a repository,
so `lupin run` cannot start it.

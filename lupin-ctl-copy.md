# lupin CTL: copy

Existing commands are kept as given: `status`, `repos`, `sessions`, `enable`, `disable`, `run`, `once`, `schedule`, `pause`, `resume`, `stop`, `peek`, `attach`, plus `join` from the mockups. New commands are `roadmap`, `place`, and `quest`. `place` is new: it is not
the existing `lupin route <category> <size>` (which still only picks a
`{model, effort}` for a task — unchanged). `place` takes a task already
matched to a model and decides which machine runs it. Marked **(proposed)**: those, `--dag`, `--json`, and optional `repo[#N]` on `pause`/`resume`. Rename freely.

---

## 1. Model-facing section (system prompt / tool description)

```
lupin is the control CLI for the delegation loops on this machine group. Use it to
read the roadmap, choose where a task should run, and control loops. Run it through
the shell. Every command is safe to re-run unless noted.

Read before you act:
  lupin status                 what is running, what is scheduled, quota per provider
  lupin roadmap [--dag]        prioritized open tasks; --dag shows dependencies and blockers
  lupin quest                  quests, their progress, and which machine is focused on each
  lupin place <task>           which machine runs a task, and why

Act:
  lupin run <repo> [--loop N]  start work now
  lupin once <when> [repo…]    run one time at 15:00, +2h, or tomorrow 09:00
  lupin schedule               show or change the recurring cadence
  lupin quest focus <quest-name> [--machine M]   dedicate one machine to a quest
  lupin quest release <quest-name>               end the focus early (normally automatic)
  lupin quest start --issue N [--issue N…]   ship a few specific issues with one dedicated loop
  lupin quest status|stop [id]
  lupin pause [repo[#N]]       pause the recurring timer, or one loop
  lupin resume [repo[#N]]      resume it
  lupin stop <repo>[#N]        kill a loop session and release its task

Watch:
  lupin peek <repo> [lines]    tail of a loop session
  lupin attach <repo>          attach to a loop session

Rules:
- Check `lupin place` before `lupin run` when more than one machine could take the task.
- Prefer the provider with the most quota left that still fits the task type. Do not spend the last 10% of any provider on a task that can wait for a reset. Low quota only affects where new work goes. It never releases a focus or a claim.
- Quests ship together. When a task belongs to a quest, run it in that quest's order and on that quest's focus machine if it has one. Use `lupin roadmap --dag` to see which tasks block others, and start with those.
- Use `quest start` when the user names specific issues to ship. Use `quest focus` when the issues already share a quest label. A quest claims its issues up front and works them in dependency order.
- Focus and claims release themselves. Do not release them by hand unless the user asks. Use `--pin` only when the user wants a focus to stay.
- Tasks, quests, priorities and dependencies come from GitHub issues. Fix them in GitHub, not in lupin.
- Do not split a quest across machines unless its remaining tasks are independent in the DAG and the focus machine has no free slot.
- Tasks claimed by another loop are not yours. Skip them.
- `pause` keeps the loop's claimed task and resumes where it stopped. `stop` kills the session and releases the task back to the queue. If unsure, pause.
- With no repo, `pause` and `resume` act on the recurring timer for all repos. Name a repo to affect only its loop.
- To change when work runs, use `once` for a single run and `schedule` for the recurring cadence. Use `peek` to check a loop before you pause or stop it.
- Add `--json` for output you will parse. Without it, output is for people.
- Exit code 0 means done. 2 means nothing to do. Any other code means the command failed; read stderr before retrying.
```

### Per-command

**roadmap**
```
lupin roadmap [--repo R] [--limit N] [--stage S] [--dag] [--json]

List open tasks in priority order. Tasks claimed by other loops are marked and
excluded from "ready" counts.

  --repo R     only this repo
  --limit N    show the top N (default 10)
  --stage S    ready, blocked, or all (default ready)
  --dag        draw dependencies between tasks, grouped by quest

Examples
  lupin roadmap
  lupin roadmap --dag
  lupin roadmap --repo api-gateway --limit 3 --json
```

**quest**
```
lupin quest [--json]
lupin quest focus <quest-name> [--machine M] [--pin]
lupin quest release <quest-name>
lupin quest start --issue N [--issue N…] [--machine M] [--platform P] [--note TEXT]
lupin quest status [id]
lupin quest stop <id>

A quest is a set of tasks meant to ship together — either an issue labeled `quest`
(its sub-issues are its tasks), or a set you name directly with --issue. Plain
`lupin quest` lists each quest with progress and its focus machine.

  focus        route a labeled quest's ready tasks to one machine, in dependency
               order. Without --machine, lupin picks the machine with the most
               free slots.
  release      return the machine to normal routing. Running loops finish their step.
  --pin        keep the focus until you release it; skip automatic release.
  start        claim the named issues up front and work them in dependency order,
               under one dedicated loop. Issues can come from different repos.
  --issue N    an issue to ship; repeat for each (at least one)
  --machine M  run on this machine; default is the best fit from `lupin place`
  --platform P force a provider
  --note TEXT  extra instruction for the loop

A focus releases itself when it stops paying off; a started quest ends on its own
when every issue is closed or merged. See "How focus and claims end" below.

Examples
  lupin quest
  lupin quest focus session-rewrite --machine mac-studio
  lupin quest release session-rewrite
  lupin quest start --issue 23 --issue 24 --issue 25
  lupin quest status
  lupin quest stop q1
```

**place**
```
lupin place <task> [--explain] [--json]

Pick a machine for a task. Classifies the task and picks its model with the
existing `lupin route <category> <size>` logic, then compares quota left,
time to reset, and free slots across the machines that can run that model.
<task> is an issue number (#418) or a short description.

  --explain    show the scores behind the pick

Examples
  lupin place "#418"
  lupin place "migrate session store" --explain
```

**pause / resume**
```
lupin pause [repo[#N]]
lupin resume [repo[#N]]

With no repo, stop or start the recurring timer for all repos. Running loops finish
their current step. With a repo, pause only that loop: it stops after the current
step and keeps its claimed task. <repo>#N picks loop N when a repo has several.

Examples
  lupin pause
  lupin pause api-gateway#2
  lupin resume api-gateway#2
```

**stop**
```
lupin stop <repo>[#N]

Kill a loop session. Its task goes back to the queue and its branch and notes are
kept. Prefer `pause` if the work should continue later.
```

**schedule**
```
lupin schedule [options]

With no options, show the recurring cadence and the next run for each repo. Options
change the cadence. Use `once` for a single run instead.
```

**peek / attach**
```
lupin peek <repo> [lines]     print the last lines (default 40) of the loop session
lupin attach <repo>           attach to the live session; detach to leave it running
```

**once**
```
lupin once <when> [--note TEXT] [--platform P] [repo…]

Start loops later, one time. <when> accepts 15:00, +2h, or tomorrow 09:00. Times are
local to the coordinator. With no repo, every enabled repo runs.
```

**join**
```
lupin join <coordinator>

Add this machine to the group. Run it on the machine you are adding.
```

---

## 3. Where data comes from (GitHub)

```
Quest        an issue labeled `quest` (sub-issues are its tasks), or named directly with --issue
Priority     labels P1, P2, P3 (lower number first); unlabeled sorts last
Dependency   GitHub "blocked by" links
Done         issue closed, or its PR merged
Claimed      a loop has assigned itself the issue
```
lupin re-reads GitHub on every command and caches for 60s. `--refresh` forces a re-read.
Missing or broken data is reported, not guessed:
```
warning: #440 has no priority label. Sorted last.
warning: #431 depends on #999, which does not exist. Treated as unblocked.
```

## 4. How focus and claims end

**Quest focus releases when any of these is true**
```
done        every task in the quest is closed or merged
closed      the quest issue is closed
stalled     no ready task for 15m and the open ones wait on work outside the quest
idle        the focus machine has had free slots and no ready quest task for 30m
down        the focus machine is offline, draining, or disabled
```
Low quota never releases a focus. The focus machine keeps the quest and waits for the reset.
On `down`, focus moves to the next best machine when one can continue the quest, and ends only if none can.

**Focus is kept when**
```
- remaining tasks wait only on a quest task running on the focus machine
- quota is low or out; the quest waits for the reset on the same machine
- a short gap is expected: a blocker clears within 15m
- it was set with --pin
```
**A started quest ends when**
```
done        every issue is closed or merged
stopped     lupin quest stop
down        its machine is offline, draining, or disabled; the quest moves to the next best machine, or ends and releases its claims if none can
```
A quest's claims follow the same stale and lost rules as any claim. Low quota never ends a quest.

**Claims release when**
```
merged       the PR merged or the issue closed
lost         no heartbeat for 10m
stale        no commit or tool activity for 30m
stopped      lupin stop
```
Low quota never releases a claim. The loop waits for the reset and keeps the task.
A released task keeps its branch and notes, so the next loop continues from them. Every release prints one line with its reason, so models can tell what happened.
